Command line tool and library of useful Java classes for working with smart cards and smart card readers via [JSR268](https://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=268) (commonly known as [javax.smartcardio](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/jre/api/security/smartcardio/spec/javax/smartcardio/package-summary.html)). While focus is on desktop PC/SC readers, some code can be re-used with arbitrary "APDU-command-response-ish" interfaces, either as [CommandAPDU](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/jre/api/security/smartcardio/spec/javax/smartcardio/CommandAPDU.html)/[ResponseAPDU](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/jre/api/security/smartcardio/spec/javax/smartcardio/ResponseAPDU.html) pairs or plain byte arrays.

## Features
* PinPad support (PC/SC v2 part 10 / CCID)
* Fixes all the stupid things with Java on non-windows platforms: OSX, Debian, Ubuntu, Fedora, CentOS, FreeBSD.
* Java tools for convenient APDU logging, PIN handling and more
* Bundles [jnasmartcardio][jnasmartcardio] in the command line tool for easy testing with a sane `javax.smartcardio` implementation with reader locking
* Easy to use [`RemoteTerminal`](https://martinpaljak.github.io/apdu4j/apdu4j/remote/RemoteTerminal.html) for building central services
  * Combine with [GlobalPlatformPro](https://github.com/martinpaljak/GlobalPlatformPro) for flexible central provisioning

### Get it now!
* Download latest pre-built .JAR or .EXE from [release area](https://github.com/martinpaljak/apdu4j/releases)
* Or fetch from github and build it yourself, it is really easy (more instructions in [CONTRIBUTING](./CONTRIBUTING.md)):

```shell
git clone https://github.com/martinpaljak/apdu4j
cd apdu4j
mvn package
ant
```

### Usage from command line
 * Before you begin:
   * You can run the command line utility anywhere where Java runs, like this:

         java -jar apdu4j.jar
   * But it is easier to add an alias or use a wrapper.            
   * On Linux add an alias to the shell like this:

         alias sc="java -jar $(PWD)/apdu4j.jar"
         # Now you can avoid typing java -jar and sc works from any folder
         sc -h

   * On Windows just use pre-packaged `apdu4j.exe` like this or rename it:

         apdu4j.exe -h

 * Display all options:

       sc -h
 
 * List readers:

       sc -l
   
   Will produce something like

       [ ] Gemalto Ezio Shield 01 00
       [*] ACS ACR 38U-CCID 02 00

   The presence of a card or token is indicated with the asterisk
 * Be verbose:

       sc -l -v
       
   Will produce:

       # Using jnasmartcardio.Smartcardio - JNA2PCSC version 0.2
       # Found 4 terminals
       [X] [   ] Yubico Yubikey 4 U2F+CCID
                 3BF81300008131FE15597562696B657934D4
       [ ] [VMD] Gemalto Ezio Shield 01 00
       [*] [   ] ACS ACR 38U-CCID 02 00
                 3BF91300008131FE454A434F503234325233A2
       [ ] [   ] ACS ACR 38U-CCID 03 00

   In addition to the ATR of the inserted card below the reader, PinPad features of the terminal are shown: V - PIN verification, M - PIN modification, D - display. X instead of the asterisk indicates a reader used exclusively by some other application.

 * Take you directly to the [online ATR database](http://smartcard-atr.appspot.com/)

       sc -l -v -w

 * Use a virtual smart card reader provider (format for `-p` is `jar:class:args`, where `args` part can be URL-encoded):
       
       sc -p some.jar:com.example.VirtualTerminalProvider:tcp%3A%2F%2F192.168.1.1%3A7000 -lv

 * Send the APDU `00A40C0000` to the card:

       sc -a 00A40C0000

 * The same with forced T=0 protocol (similar for T=1):

       sc -t0 -a 00A40C0000

 * The same, with an additional APDU, while dumping everything to `card.dump`
 
       sc -t0 -a 00A40C0000 -a 80:01:04:00:00 -dump card.dump

 * SunPCSC - use specific PC/SC library:

       sc -lib /usr/local/lib/pcsclite.so -l

 * SunPCSC - don't issue `GET RESPONSE` commands:

       sc -no-get-response -a 00A4040000 -v

 * Show APDU-s sent to the card (using `LoggingCardTerminal`):
   
   add `-debug` or `-d` to your command

 * Be verbose:
   
   add `-verbose` or `-v` to your command

### Usage from Java
Include the dependency

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.github.martinpaljak</groupId>
    <artifactId>apdu4j</artifactId>
    <version>17.11.26</version>
</dependency>
```

More information can be found from [Javadocs](https://martinpaljak.github.io/apdu4j), which are always improving.

Before anything make sure you set the necessary properties to make javax.smartcardio work without tuning:

```java
import apdu4j.TerminalManager;
TerminalManager.fixPlatformPaths();
```

#### LoggingCardTerminal
 * Show a debugging trace (like `-d`) of PC/SC calls and exhanged APDU-s with timing on System.out:
 
```java
import apdu4j.LogginCardTerminal;
        
TerminalFactory f = TerminalFactory.getDefault();
CardReader r = f.terminals().terminal("Your Smart Card Reader Name");
reader = LoggingCardTerminal.getInstance(reader);
// Now use javax.smartcardio as you normally do
```

 * This will give you output similar to:
```
SCardConnect("SCM Microsystems Inc. SCR 355 00 00", T=*) -> T=1, 3BFC180000813180459067464A00680804000000000E
SCardBeginTransaction("SCM Microsystems Inc. SCR 355 00 00")
A>> T=1 (4+0000) 00A40400 00 
A<< (0018+2) (17ms) 6F108408A000000003000000A5049F6501FF 9000
A>> T=1 (4+0000) 80CA9F7F 00 
A<< (0000+2) (11ms) 6A88
```

 * Dump all APDU communication with a card to a file:

```java
import apdu4j.LogginCardTerminal;
        
TerminalFactory tf = TerminalFactory.getDefault();
CardReader r = tf.terminals().terminal("Your Smart Card Reader Name");
FileOutputStream o = new FileOutputStream(new File("card.dump"));
reader = LoggingCardTerminal.getInstance(reader, o);
// Now use javax.smartcardio as you normally do
```
 * This will make a dump file similar to this:

```

### History and motivation

When working with [GlobalPlatformPro](https://github.com/martinpaljak/GlobalPlatformPro) and [JavaCard](http://javacard.pro)-s, some low level code wanted to sneak into projects where it did not belong, so it made sense to capture it into a separate library. Also, while command line tools for accessing readers on APDU (PC/SC) level existed for C, nothing was available for doing the same via Java stack, thus the need for a DWIM command line tool.
